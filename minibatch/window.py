class WindowEmitter(object):
    """
    a window into a stream of buffered objects

    WindowEmitter.run() implements the generic emitter protocol as follows:

    1. determine if a window is ready to be processed
    2. retrieve the data from the buffer to create a Window
    3. process the data (i.e. mark the buffered data processed)
    4. run the emit function on the window

    Note that run() is blocking. Between running the protocol,
    it will sleep to conserve resources.

    Each time run() wakes up, it will call the following methods in turn:

        window_ready() - called to determine if the buffer contains enough
                         data for a window.
        query()        - return the Buffer objects to process
        process()      - process the data
        timestamp()    - timestamp the stream for the next processing
        commit()       - commit processed data back to the buffer. by
                         default this means removing the objects from the
                         buffer and deleting the window.
        sleep()        - sleep until the next round

    Use timestamp() to mark the stream (or the buffer data) for the next
    round. Use sleep() to set the amount of time to sleep. Depending on
    the emitter's semantics this may be a e.g. a fixed interval or some
    function of the data.

    WindowEmitter implements several defaults:

        process() - mark all data returned by query() as processed
        sleep()   - sleep self.interval / 2 seconds
        undo()    - called if the emit function raises an exception. marks
                    the data returned by query() as not processed and deletes
                    the window

    For examples of how to implement a custom emitter see TimeWindow,
    CountWindow and SampleFunctionWindow.

    Note there should only be one WindowEmitter per stream. This is a
    a limitation of the Buffer's way of marking documentes as processed
    (a boolean flag). This decision was made in favor of performance and
    simplicity.  Supporting concurrent emitters would mean each Buffer object
    needs to keep track of which emitter has processed its data and make
    sure Window objects are processed by exactly one emitter.
